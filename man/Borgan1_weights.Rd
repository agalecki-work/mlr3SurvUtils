\title{Calculate Borgan I Weights for a Case-Cohort Study}
\usage{
Borgan1_weights(data, subcoh, event, sampling_fraction = 0.15)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the study data.}

\item{subcoh}{A string specifying the column name in \code{data} that identifies whether an observation is part of the subcohort (1 for yes, 0 for no).}

\item{event}{A string specifying the column name in \code{data} that indicates the occurrence of the event of interest (1 if the event occurred, 0 otherwise).}

\item{sampling_fraction}{A numeric value representing the proportion of the entire cohort that is sampled to form the subcohort. Default is 0.15.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of weights for each individual in the \code{data} frame.
}
\description{
This function calculates weights for a case-cohort study using the Borgan I method.
These weights adjust for the sampling strategy to ensure representative estimates from the subcohort.
}
\details{
The function assigns weights as follows:
\itemize{
\item Members of the subcohort who did not have the event receive a weight equal to the reciprocal of the sampling fraction.
\item Members of the subcohort who had the event receive a weight of 1.
\item Non-subcohort members who had the event receive a weight of 1.
}

The weights ensure that the sampled subcohort provides unbiased estimates of the full cohort.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
df <- data.frame(subcoh = c(1, 0, 1, 0, 1), event = c(0, 1, 1, 1, 0))
weights <- Borgan1_weights(df, "subcoh", "event", 0.15)
print(weights)
